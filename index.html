	<h1>Point Location in Dynamic Planar Subdivisions</h1>

		This webpage serves as a detailed overview of Oh and Ahn's data structure toward a fully dynamic point location algorithm. The method of Oh and Ahn achieves an amortized update time of $O(\sqrt{n}logn{(loglogn)}^{3/2})$ and a query time of $O(logn{(loglogn)}^2)$, where $n$ is the number of edges in the subdivisions. When the user is restricted to only deleting edges from the initial subdivision, their method provides $O(\alpha(n))$ update time and $O(logn)$ query time, where $\alpha()$ is the inverse ackerman function.

	<h2> Background </h2>
		<p>
			Given a set of non-intersecting edges that subdivide the plane into non-overlapping faces, the goal is to design a dynamic data structure that can support the operation $locate(x)$ in which the user provides a query point $x$ in the plane, and the face containing $x$ is reported to the user. Note that the subdivision need not be connected, provided that there are no intersecting edges. <b> FIGURE NEEDED </b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The fundamental terminology relevant to the dynamic approach is largely the same as that of the static approach. There are, however, some basic concepts that are novel and essential to understanding the method of Oh and Ahn.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Half-edges.</b> Every edge in the subdivision is considered to be comprised of two directed edges oriented such that the face incident to the half-edge lies to its left relative to its direction. Note that while edges are considered to be comprised of two half-edges, all operations concerning edges (Remove, Insert) involve the whole, indivisible edge. <b> FIGURE NEEDED </b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Outer/Inner Boundaries.</b> The presence of half-edges motivates a more concrete distinction for the different kinds of boundaries a face in the subdivision can have. An <i> Outer Boundary </i> is the component defining the boundary of a face, $F$, such that $F$ is incident to the half-edges traversable in a counter-clockwise orientation. Every other connected component incident to $F$ is called an <i>Inner Boundary</i>. <b> FIGURE NEEDED </b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Edge types.</b> All edges are said to be in one of three states: old, communal, and new. The exact way in which edges change types will be explained in the update algorithms.
		</p>
	<h2> Data Structure Overview </h2>
		<p> 
			The data structure, $D$, used to resolve queries is comprised of two data structures, one containing old and communal edges, $D_o$, and the other containing new and communal edges, $D_n$. The update and query protocols for each data structure will be explained in turn.
		</p>
		<h3> Semi-Dynamic Data Structure </h3>
			<p>
				The data structure described in this section is only semi-dynamic insofar as it supports only $delete(e)$ (where $e$ is an edge in the subdivision) and $locate(x)$. The mechanics of this data structure will be explained here and its use in the fully dynamic solution will be explained later.
			</p>
			<p> 
				The semi-dynamic data structure itself consists of two components: a <b>static point location data structure</b>, which keeps track of the initial subdivision, and a <b>disjoint-set</b> of faces which keeps track the current faces in the subdivision as edges are deleted. In the static subdivison, the $m$ faces are uniquely identifiable with names $1 ... m$ (note: $m$ is $O(n)$ as this is a planar subdivision). The face identifiers are stored in a disjoint-set data structure, $S$. The mechanics of $S$ are such that two faces are in the same set if and only if the two faces have been merged into one face. As faces is in this initial subdivision do not overlap, every face in $S$ is a singleton set. An edge set containing all of the edges in the subdivision is maintained such that every every edge points to its incident face(s).
			</p>
			<p>
				When $delete(e)$ is processed, find the incident faces to $e$ in the <b>static</b> subdivision in $O(1)$ time. If $e$ is incident to two faces, $A$ and $B$, find the sets in $S$ containing $A$ and $B$. If they are in separate sets, they are merged into one set all in $O(\alpha(n))$ time. The root in $S$ corresponding to this new, merged set is given a new unique name. If the two faces are already in the same set in $S$, no change is needed. Maintaining the disjoint set in this way ensures that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the number of faces in the current subdivision and the number of disjoint sets in $S$.
			</p>
			<p>
				To resolve a $locate(x)$ query, simply resolve $locate(x)$ in the static subdivision in $O(logn)$ (let result be $F$), find the subset in $S$ that contains $F$ in $O(\alpha(n))$, and report this subset.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Key Takeaways:</b> A semi-dynamic data structure that only supports $delete(e)$ and $locate(x)$ can be achieved by simultaneously maintaining the initial static point location data structure and a disjoint-set of current faces. With $O(nlogn)$ preprocessing time to form the static data structure and $O(\alpha(n))$ update time, $O(logn)$ query time is achieved.
			</p>
		<h3> Fully Dynamic Data Structure </h3>
			<p>
				As noted, the fully dynamic point location data structure consists of two sub data structures, $D_o$ and $D_n$. For the rest of the explanation, $E_o$ and $E_n$ will refer to the set of old + communal edges and communal + new edges, respectively, and $M_o$ and $M_n$ will refer to the subdivisions induced by the corresponding edge sets. $D_o$ is thus the data structure maintaing $E_o$ and $D_n$ is the data structure maintaining $E_n$. $D_o$ is implemented as the semi-dynamic data structure explained above. This section will focus more on the mechanics $D_n$ toward a fully-dynamic data structure, and explain how edges change types.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Structure.</b> The dynamic data structure underlying $D_n$ needs to support verticle ray-shooting queries for $E_n$. The method of Oh and Ahn uses the data structure by Chan and Nekrich which achieves an update time of $O(logn \cdot loglogn)$ and a query time of $O(logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$. Also, each component of the boundary of each face in $M_n$ is stored in a concatenable queue. This queue supports insertion, deletion, splitting the queue into two, and merging two queus into one. The edges for a given boundary component can thus be accesed sequentially as they appear in the boundary, and the queues for each boundary component can be merged so the boundary components for $M_n$ can be traversed. By implementing the queue with a 2-3 tree, all operations are supported in $O(logn)$ time where $n$ is the number of elements in the queue. The organization of this queue is briefly described as follows:
				<ul>
					<li> Choose an element of the queue, make this the root of the 2-3 tree (and thus the way to access the elements of the queue) </li>
					<li> If the queue represents an outer boundary of $F$, make the root point to the roots of all inner boundaries of $F$ </li>
					<li> If the queue represents an inner boundary of $F$, make the root point to the root of the corresponding outer boundary of $F$ </li>
				</ul>
				Note that since a given edge can be incident to at most two faces, that edge will be stored twice in the queue as a boundary components for the two incident faces. Also, every edge in $E_n$ points to the corresponding element(s) in the queue.
			</p>
			<p>
				The vertices in $M_n$ are maintained in a balanced BST so that there can be a check if a point in the plane is a vertex of $M_n$ in $O(logn)$. Additionally, for every vertex, th edges in $M_n$ adjacent to it are stored in BST in clockwise order around the vertex.
			</p>
			<b><i> NOTE TO SELF: The root of the queue representing the entire subdivision could be outer face of the subdivision to which everything is an inner boundary. This allows a mechanism to systematically access every face's particular queue. The paper doesn't say this so maybe it isn't necessary (or is assumed to be obvious) </i></b>
			<p>
				<b>Reconstruction Period.</b> Before explaining the update mechanics for the data structure, the notion of a reconstruction period needs to be introduced. Let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be an increasing function such that $f(n)/2 \le f(n/2) \le n/4$ for every $n$ greater than some constant. $f(n)$ defines what is called a <i>reconstruction period</i> for the data structure in which $f(n)$ updates are allowed to be processed before the data structure gets rebuilt. Here, $n$ is the number of edges currently in the data structure. Rebuilding the data structure consists of building the static point location data structure in $O(nlogn)$ from the existing subdivision after $f(n)$ edges are inserted/deleted. This notion will be a critical component in the amortized runtime analysis. The specific $f(n)$ will be established later, but the reader can take $f(n)$ to be any $O(\sqrt{n})$ function as a concrete example for the reconstruction time (in truth, any $f$ such that $f(n) = o(n)$ satsifies the above condition).
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Mechanics.</b> When the data structure is rebuilt at the end of a reconstruction period, every edge is set to old, so $D_n$ is empty. When $insert(e)$ is executed, the one face, $F$, in $M_o$ that $e$ intersects is found in $O(logn)$ time. All edges on the <b>outer</b> boundary of $F$ are set to communal. If $e$ is inserted such that it connects the outer boundary of $F$ to an inner boundary of $F$, then the edges on the inner boundary are set to communal as well. The new edge that is inserted is set to new. Notice that after this insertion, $D_n$ is always populated with at least $e$ and the outer boundary of $F$, and it may also be populated with a certain inner boundary of $F$ if the condition above is met. Similarly, when $delete(e)$ is executed, the outer boundary of the face(s) incident to $e$ is set to communal.
			</p> 
			<h4>Edge Insertion</h4>
			<p>
				Executing $insert(e)$ entails updating $D_n$ (for $D_o$, edges only change in type but the structure itself remains the same), which in turn entails updating the vertical ray-shooting structure, the concatenable queue, and the pointers in the edges of $E_n$. As noted, when an edge is inserted, the outer boundary of its intersecting face (and possibly the inner boundary if necessary) is changed to communal. Assuming these edges were not already communal, they all need to be inserted into $D_n$ along with $e$. Oh and Ahn prove that the average number of such edges that are made communal at any given time is $O(n / f(n))$. Therefore, the total time needed to update the vertical ray-shooting structure is $O(n / f(n) \cdot logn \cdot loglogn)$, as $O(logn \cdot loglogn)$ is the update time for a single edge given by Chan and Nekrich. The mechanics for how the structure handles updates are likewise discussed by Chan and Nekrich.
			</p>
			<p>
				The process for inserting newly-made communal edges into the contaneable queue is more nuanced. Let $\gamma$ be the newly communal boundary edges induced by adding $e$. If $e$ connects the outer boundary of $F$ to an inner boundary of $F$, then $\gamma$ is the cycle consisting of the outer boundary, the inner boundary, and $e$. Otherwise, $\gamma$ is just the outer boundary. If $\gamma$ consists entirely of edges that were communal prior to $insert(e)$, then $\gamma$ is already in the concatenable queue and no update is needed. Therefore, the description assumes that $\gamma$ consists of at least one old edge. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh and Ahn prove (Lemma 7) that if $\gamma$ contains at least one old edge, then $\gamma$ will not intersect a connected component that is both enclosed by $\gamma$ and is already in $E_n$. Put another way, if $F_\gamma$ is a face induced by $\gamma$ coming from $E_o$, $F_\gamma$ will not be truncated when added to $M_n$ due to $\gamma$ overlapping with a face already in $M_n$ that is inside of $\gamma$ (all provided $\gamma$ has at least one old edge) <b>FIGURE NEEDED</b>. A consequence of this is that after all of the communal edges of $\gamma$ are inserted, there is a unique face in $M_n$ whose outer boundary is $\gamma$. Let $F$ be the face in $M_n$ that $\gamma$ intersects. Adding $\gamma$ to $M_n$ subdivides $F$ into sub-faces, one of which is $F_\gamma$. Updating the concatenable queue, therefore, requires generating a queue for $F_\gamma$ and managing the necessary changes due to subdividing $F$.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Concatenable queue for outer boundary of $F_\gamma$.</b> After $\gamma$ is produced, walk along the edges in sequence <b><i> (NOTE TO SELF: How do we access the edges in sequence, is that why we have a concatenable queue for $M_o$?)</i></b>. Every old edge is inserted into a newly created concatenable queue. If the current old edge, $e_o$, is incident to a communal edge, $e_c$, then $e_c$ is the beginning of a polygonal chain that is already part of the concatenable queue for some face in $M_n$ which connects $e_o$ to the next old edge in $\gamma$. Given $e_c$, its spot in the existing concatenable queue can be found in $O(1)$ as pointers from edges to their corresponding elements in the concatenable queue are maintained. When the connected component which $e_c$ is a part of is accessed, it is split at two points: 1. the junction of $e_c$ and $e_o$ and 2. the junction of the next old edge in $\gamma$ and the end communal edge that comes before it (the last edge in this polygonal chain). One part of this split is merged with the concatenable queue for $\gamma$, and the other is saved for updating the boundary of $F$. The total time is $O(Nlogn)$ when $N$ is the number of old edges in $\gamma$ which become communal.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Concatenable queue for inner boundaries of $F_\gamma$.</b> It is possible for $F_\gamma$ to enclose faces, $\beta$, that were already in $M_n$. Note that if $F_\gamma$ is inside $F$, all $\beta$ that are inside $F_\gamma$ as a result of adding it to the subdivision were previously inner boundaries of $F$. For each inner boundary $\beta$ of $F$ (accesible by the pointers in the root of $F$), check to see if $\beta$ is inside $F_\gamma$ by the following:
				<ul>
					<li> Use the vertical ray-shooting data structure to compute the edge $e'$ immediately above the top most vertex in $\beta$
					<li> Find the boundary component $\beta_{e'}$ corresponding to $e'$ using its pointer to its element in the concatenable queue in $O(1)$
					<li> If $\beta_{e'}$ is $\gamma$
						<ul>
							<li> Determine if $\beta$ is inside $\gamma$ <b><i> They don't say how, but say it can be done "immediately" </i></b>
						</ul>
					<li> else
						<ul>
							<li> $\beta$ is an inner boundary of $F_\gamma$ if and only if $\beta_{e'}$ is an inner boundary of $F_\gamma$, so repeat the process for $\beta_{e'}$
						</ul>
				</ul>
				Do to the cascading nature of the else-block, each inner boundary only needs to be processed once. Since each $\beta$ that is determined to be an inner boundary of $F_\gamma$ was previously an inner boundary of $F$, the roots of their concatenable queues pointed to the outer boundary of $F$. To complete the update for inner boundaries, these pointers are changed to now point to $F_\gamma$ and the pointers in $F$ pointing to its inner boundaries are similarly updated. The total time for this step is, therefore, the vertical ray-shooting query time, $O(logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$, times the number of inner boundaries needed to be processed, which Oh and Ahn prove is $O(f(n))$ in $M_n$ (Lemma 2), totalling $O(f(n) \cdot logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Concatenable queues for the boundary of $F$.</b> There a few things to note before explaining this step. Looking at a boundary component is contextualized by whether one is, so to speak, observing from outside the boundary enclosure looking in at the boundary component, or whether one is inside the boundary enclosure looking out at the boundary. Suppose $F$ is a square that encloses another square whose edges $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ (listed clockwise). Inside the small square, suppose there is an edge $e$ which makes a diagonal in the square, dividing it into two faces. In the current subdivision there are three faces: $F$ and the two triangles $A$ and $B$ whose union forms the small square inside $F$. While the connected component $abcd$ does not comprise the outer boundary of a face in the subdivision, it <i>does</i> define an inner boundary component of $F$. Therefore, the presence of a connected component $C$ that defines the inner boundary of a face $F$ does not imply that $C$ defines the outer boundary of a unique face. <b>FIGURE NEEDED</b>
			</p>
			<p> 
				The significance of this is that while the inside of a face $F$ may be subdivided such that the previous outer boundary is split and is used to define outerboundaries of the subfaces (and thus the <i>face</i> $F$ does not exist in the subdivision anymore), the previous outerboundary is still needed to define the inner boundary of whatever face $F$ was inside of (say, $G$). In a similar vein, if a new face $F'$ is <i>merged</i> to $F$ along some edge(s) on the exterior of $F$, then while definitions of the outer boundaries of $F$ and $F'$ are not affected, the inner boundary viz. $G$ needs to be updated to the closed circuit of edges that encompass $F$ and $F'$. However, to repeat, this new circuit will not define a new, unique face, rather it serves merely to define a boundary component when looked at from inside $G$.
			</p>
			<p>
				When $F_\gamma$ is inserted into $M_n$ it might induce a change to the boundary definitions on the interior of $F$. After producing $\gamma$, walk along the old edges of $\gamma$ one by one, and compute all of the <i>endpoints</i> of old edges from $\gamma$ that are already in $M_n$ by using the blanaced binary search tree storing the vertices of $M_n$. (If $F_\gamma$ has no such vertices, then the outer boundary of $F$ does not change and $\gamma$ defines an inner boundary for $F$). For every edge $e'$ that is: 1. in $M_n$, 2. incident to this vertex $u$, and 3. comprises a boundary component <i>relative to $F$ </i> (<b>FIGURE NEEDED</b>), its boundary component is accessed (in $O(1)$) and split about $u$. For one such boundary component split about $u$, one polygonal chain split at $u$ is used to comprise the outer boundary of $F_\gamma$ and is appended to its concatenable queue (as explained abov), while the other (Note: there might not be another <b>FIGURE NEEDED</b>) is used to comprise the outer boundary of another subface. Notice that all old edges in $\gamma$ will contribute to the outer boundaries of two new subfaces, one of which is $F_\gamma$, while each polygonal chain induced by splitting the boundary components at junctions with old edges in $\gamma$ is used to comprise the outery boundary of one new subface. Notice further that as $F$ is being internally subdivided, the previous outer boundary of $F$ is not affected viz. its use as an inner boundary for the face enclosing it. In this way, by splitting the boundary components and merging the polygonal chains with the appropriate old edges of $\gamma$, the concatenable queues of the new subfaces of $F$ can be computed in $O(Nlogn)$ time where $N$ is the number of old edges in $\gamma$ which become communal. Connected components that were previously inner boundaries of $F$ can be reassociated to their new enclosing face by determining which of the new sub-faces encloses it in a similar process outlined above concerning inner boundaries. The total time for this step would thus be $O(f(n) \cdot logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$.
			</p>
			<p>
				When $F_\gamma$ is inserted into $M_n$ such that its exterior merges with the exteriors of other faces already in $M_n$, the faces' outer boundaries do not change, but the edges of some face $F$ that $F_\gamma$ shares can no longer comprise the <i>inner</i> boundary of the face $G$ that encloses $F$ <b>FIGURE NEEDED</b>. Merging $F_\gamma$ with $F$ thus necessitates creating a new innerboundary for $G$ using the appropriate edges from both $F$ and $F_\gamma$. The appropriate boundaries can computed in a similar way as when $F$ is subdivided in its interior by finding junctions of old edges in $\gamma$ and edges already in $M_n$, splitting the boundary components, and merging the polygonal chains as necessary. The time in this case is the same as the other case.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b><i>How does it work if you make a completely new face in the subdivision by inserting new edges?</i></b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Pointers for Edges.</b> The final step in updating the data structure for $insert(e)$ is making sure the edges in $E_n$ point to the correct elements in the concatenable queue. As in this step edges are only inserted, the only edges whose pointers are modified are the old edges in $\gamma$ that are changed to communal. In this case, when the old edges are inserted into the concatenable queue, the edge can be added to $E_n$ and the pointer can be set to the new element in the queue.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time to execute all operations on the concatenable queue is $O(logn)$. The time needed to query the vertical ray-shooting structure is $O(logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$ and the time to update it is is $O(logn \cdot log log n)$. After $f(n)$ updates, the static data structure is rebuilt from the current edges in the subdivision in $O(nlogn)$ time, amortizing to $O(nlogn / f(n))$ per update during the reconstruction period. The total number of communal edges that need to be inserted into the dynamic data structure after any update is $O(n / f(n))$. Therefore, the total amortized update time for $insert(e)$ is $O(f(n) \cdot logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2} + nlogn/f(n) + n \cdot logn \cdot log log n / f(n))$, which simplifies to $O(f(n) \cdot logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2} + n / f(n) \cdot logn \cdot log log n )$.
			</p>
			<h4>Edge Deletion</h4>
			<p>
				When an edge is deleted, $\gamma$ is produced from $M_o$ and newly-made communal edges are inserted into $M_n$ in the same manner as when $insert(e)$ is executed. Executing $delete(e)$ entails updating the semi-dynamic $D_o$ as explained above, as well as the concatenable queues for the faces in the subdivision comprised of old and communal edges. For $D_n$, the concatenable queues for the new and communal edges need to be updated along with the pointers of the effected edges in $E_n$. There are four cases for how $e$ can be oriented relative to its incident face(s): both endpoints of $e$ lie on the same connected component, the two endpoints lie on two distinct connected components, only one endpoint lies on a connected component, or no edges lie on a connected component <b>FIGURE NEEDED</b>. The necessary updates will be discussed for each case.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Case 1: Two faces $F_1$ and $F_2$ are merged into one face $F$.</b> The two queues representing the boundary components $F_1$ and $F_2$ can be found in constant time. The queues are split along their junctions with $e$ and merged in $O(logn)$ time. The previous inner boundaries of $F_1$ and $F_2$ are made to point to the newly formed $F$ which now encloses them. As there are $O(f(n))$ inner boundaries, this can be done in $O(f(n))$ time. The pointers in $E_n$ do not change.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Case 2: A boundary component $\gamma$ of $F$ is split into two boundary components of $F$.</b> The boundary component containing $e$ is found in constant time. $e$ is removed from this component creating to separate boundary components. If the boundary component was an inner boundary of $F$, the two components are made to point at $F$. Otherwise, $e$ connects the outerboundary of $F$ to an inner boundary of $F$, so one of the resulting boundary components becomes the exclusive outer boundary of $F$ and the other is an inner boundary of $F$. This is all done in $O(logn)$ time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Case 3: An edge of a boundary component $\gamma$ disappears.</b> The edge is simply removed from the $\gamma$ and $\gamma$ does not need to be split into two new connected components. The time for this case is $O(logn)$.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Case 4: A boundary component $\gamma$ disappears.</b> In this case, the connected component $\gamma$ consists exclusively of $e$. The singleton queue is thus removed, and the pointer from its enclosing face $F$ to it is removed as well. This case can be done in constant time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The total time to simply delete the edge from the data structure and handle the inner boundary pointers is $O(f(n) + logn)$. To insert the communal edges induced by deleting $e$ is $O(f(n) \cdot logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2} + n / f(n) \cdot logn \cdot log log n )$ as before. Likewise, the amortized reconstruction time is $O(nlogn / f(n))$. Removing $e$ from the vertical ray-shooting data structure is $O(logn \cdot log log n)$. Therefore, the total cost to process $delete(e)$ reduces to $O(f(n) \cdot logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2} + n / f(n) \cdot logn \cdot log log n )$, the same as for $insert(e)$.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Key Takeaways.</b> The fully dynamic data structure utilizes the vertical ray-shooting data structure of Chan and Nekrich and a concatenable queue (implemented as 2-3 trees) for all connected components for the new and communal edges. A reconstruction period is defined in which $f(n)$ updates are allowed where $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is an increasing function such that $f(n)/2 \le f(n/2) \le n/4$ for every $n$ greater than some constant. After the reconstruction period, the static data structure is made from all edges in the current subdivision. The dynamic data structure can be maintained such that it allows the insertion and deletion of edges in $O(f(n) \cdot logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2} + n / f(n) \cdot logn \cdot log log n )$.

	<h2> Query Procedure </h2>
	<p>
		The goal of this section is to explain how to answer $locate(x)$ where $x$ is a point in the plane. The complete subdivision $M$ is the union of $M_o$ and $M_n$ which is underlied by $D_o$ and $D_n$. Let $F_o$ and $F_n$ be the faces in $M_o$ and $M_n$, respectively, containing the point $x$. $F_o$ can be calculated in $O(logn)$ as described above. For $F_n$, the edge $e$ immediately above $x$ is calculated using the vertical ray-shooting data structure in $D_n$. The two faces incident to $e$ are accessed in $O(1)$. Oh an Ahn argue that because the half-edges for an edge are oriented consistenly, it can be determined which of the two faces contain $x$ in constant time. However, I do not see how this is possible because the orientation of $e$ will be the same relative to $x$ whether $e$ forms an outer boundary relative to $x$ (and $x$ is inside that outer boundary), or $e$ forms an inner boundary relative to $x$ (and $x$ is in the face enclosing $e$). It is not obvious to me how this can be determined with only a constant number of additional calculations. Nonetheless, it will be assumed that Oh and Ahn's assertion is corrected and that $F_n$ is calculable in $O(logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are three lemmas in Oh and Ahn's paper that are necessary for resolving queries. The proofs are presented as they appear in the paper as they are short, straightforward, and essential to answering point location queries. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b> Lemma 10. </b> <i>No face of $M$ contains both an old edge and a new edge in its outer boundary.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Proof.</i> Assume to the contrary that both a new edge $e_n$ and an old edge $e_o$ lie on the outer boundary of a face $F$ of $M$. Note that $e_n$ is inserted after the latest reconstruction. When $e_n$ was inserted, all outer boundary edges of the face $F'$ that was intersected by $e_n$ in $M_o$ at the moment were set to communal. Since a communal edge is set to old only by a reconstruction, the only possibility for $e_o$ to remain as old is that $e_o$ was not on the outer boundary of $F'$ but on the outer boundary of another face in $M_o$, and after then it has become an outer boundary edge of $F$ by a series of splits and merges of the faces that are incident to $e_o$. These splits and merges occur only by insertions and deletions of edges, and $e_o$ is set to communal by such a change to the face that is incident to $e_o$, and remains communal afterwards. This contradicts that $e_o$ is old, and this case never occurs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b> Lemma 11. </b> <i>For any face $F$ in $M$, there exists a face in $M_o$ or in $M_n$ whose outer boundary coincides with the outer boundary of $F$.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Proof.</i> By Lemma 10, the outer boundary of $F$ contains either no new edge or no old edge. Consider the case that the outer boundary of $F$ contains no new edge, that is, all edges on the outer boundary of $F$ are in $M_o$. No edge of $M_o$ intersects $F$ because all edges of $M_o$ appear in $M$ but no edge of $M$ intersects $F$. Thus there is a face in $M_o$ whose outer boundary coincides with the outer boundary of $F$. The lemma for the case that the outer boundary of $F$ contains no old edge can similarly be proven.

		<b> Lemma 12. </b> <i>For any two points in the plane, they are in the same face in $M$ if and only if they are in the same face in $M_o$ and in the same face in $M_n$.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Proof.</i> Assume that two points $x$ and $y$ are in the same face $F$ in $M$. There is a face $F'$ in $M_o$ or in $M_n$ whose outer boundary coincides with the outer boundary of $F$ by Lemma 11. Consider a face $F''$ in $M_o$ or $M_n$ enclosde by $F'$. Neither $x$ nor $y$ is enclosed by $F$ because the edge set of $M_o$ (and $M_n$) is a subset of the edge set of $M$. Since the complete subdivision $M$ is planar, this implies that $x$ and $y$ are in the same face in both $M_o$ and $M_n$. Now assume that two points $x$ and $y$ are in different faces in $M$. Let $F_x$ and $F_y$ be the faces containing $x$ and $y$ in $M$, respectively. This means that $x$ is not enclosed by $F_y$ or $y$ is not enclosed by $F_x$. The outer boundaries of $F_x$ and $F_y$ are distinct. By Lemma 11, there are faces $F_x'$ and $F_y'$ in $M_o$ or in $M_n$ whose outer boundaries coincide with the outer boundaries of $F_x$ and $F_y$, respectively. Note that $x$ is enclosed by $F_x'$ and $y$ is enclosed by $F_y'$. However, either $x$ is not enclosed by $F_y'$ or $y$ is not enclosed by $F_x'$. Therefore, $x$ and $y$ are in different faces in $M_o$ or $M_n$, which proves the lemma.

		As a consequence of Lemma 12, all points in $F$ in $M$ map to the same pair of faces in $M_o$ and $M_n$. All faces in $M$ are thus uniquely identifiable by theses two faces. Therefore, if $F_o$ and $F_n$ are known, $F$ can be found by mapping the names of $F_o$ and $F_n$ to the unique face $F$ associated with those faces. Oh and Ahn do not explain how this mapping is maintained or if the association of $F_o$, $F_n$, and $F$ is calculated when the former two are found. If the mapping is maintained, the locating $F$ from $F_o$ and $F_n$ would ostensibly take constant time, while the overhead for maintaing the mapping is left out. If the mapping is calculated for each query, it is not clear that this can be done in constant time, or at least time strictly less than the time to query the vertical ray-shooting data structure. Regardless, the mapping indeed exists as proven, and Oh and Ahn assert that the time for $locate(x)$ resolution is equal to the time to query the vertical ray-shooting data structure: $O(logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$.

		<b>Key Takeaways:</b> Every point $x$ in a face $F$ from the complete subdivision $M$ will be in the same pair of faces $F_o$ and $F_n$ in $M_o$ and $M_n$. The faces $F_o$ and $F_n$ can be found in $O(logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$, and the mapping to $F$ can be executed with no additional overhead. Therefore, $locate(x)$ can be executed in $O(logn \cdot {(loglogn)}^{2})$.
